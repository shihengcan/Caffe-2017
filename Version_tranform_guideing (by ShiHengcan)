step1: Copy all files in following folders to new caffe
       skip files with the same name in two different caffes:

            ./include/caffe/
            ./src/caffe/
 

step1.1: Copy "sigmoid_cross_entropy_loss_layer" in following folders to new caffe
         replace the file with the same name in the new caffe:

            ./include/caffe/
            ./src/caffe/ 


step2: Copy the "serial numbers" and "parameters" of new layers in following files
       and paste them to the corresponding files in new caffe:

            ./src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto


step3: Copy code snippets signed by "jay add" in following files
       and paste them to the corresponding files in new caffe:

            ./include/caffe/blob.hpp
            ./src/caffe/blob.cpp


step4: Copy code snippets signed by "shihengcan add"
       and such code ' #include "caffe/data_reader.hpp" ' in following files
       and paste them to the corresponding files in new caffe:

            ./src/caffe/util/blocking_queue.cpp
